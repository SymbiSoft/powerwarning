Remote monitoring of home power presence - remote intrusion detection system

By means of monitoring battery charger status (connected or not), this program allows knowing if home power grid is working or not, and it sends an SMS in case of power failure.

By inserting the charger into a circuit which monitors doors/windows for opening, the SMS can be triggered by doors/windows opening.

Program written in Pys60 and tested on nokia 6600/6680.
